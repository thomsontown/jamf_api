#	This script was written when I noticed a number of machines with no Last-Check-in date in the JSS. Depending 
#	on the size of your enterprise and the number of enrolled computers, this script will take some time to complete.
#	You can pipe the results to a file to save the results. Otherwise the output is to stdout.
